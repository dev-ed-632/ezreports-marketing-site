Project Name: Data-Driven Reporting & Analytics Platform
1. Introduction
The Data-Driven Reporting & Analytics Platform is a web-based solution that allows users to upload various data formats and generate insightful reports. Users can apply custom rules, visualize data with charts, and leverage AI for predictive analytics. The system will provide a scalable and future-proof infrastructure to support large datasets and advanced reporting features.

OAuth & JWT-based authentication
Payments
Data Upload & Processing
Support for multiple file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL, XML, YAML,Parquet)
Automatic data cleaning & transformation using Pandas
Custom column mapping
Asynchronous processing with RabbitMQ & Celery
Data storage in PostgreSQL and file storage in S3/MinIO
Caching mechanisms with Redis for improved performance
Report Generation
Predefined & custom reports
Interactive dashboards
Export options (PDF, Excel, CSV)
Graphical Visualization
Bar charts, line charts, pie charts, heatmaps, scatter plots, Sankey diagrams, and more
Dynamic filtering and sorting
Custom Rule Engine
Users can define custom formulas and calculations

8. Development Process & Challenges
8.1 Development Approach
Agile methodology with iterative development
Modular architecture for independent feature development (We will add the basic project requirement of creating reports from different datasets then we will add the complete user flow of registration, payments, subscriptions, dashboards, report history etc) [2.1.2 & 2.1.3]
CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration & deployment
Unit & integration testing to ensure robustness
8.2 Challenges & Solutions
Handling Large Datasets: Batch processing with RabbitMQ + Celery, columnar storage (Parquet)
Fast Query Performance: Redis caching, indexing & partitioning in PostgreSQL
Complex Custom Calculations: Custom rule engine, on-the-fly computation with Pandas
User-Friendly Data Exploration: Interactive UI, auto-generated insights with AI
9.0 Timeline
Design - 2 Weeks (Figma) 
Frontend - 4 Weeks (React Next Js, MUI) ()
Backend - 14 Weeks (Python, Postgrees, Rabit MQ )
â€”------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total 20 Weeks





9. Conclusion
This project aims to provide a robust and scalable reporting solution with rich data visualisation and AI-driven analytics. The architecture ensures high performance, security, and adaptability for future enhancements.
